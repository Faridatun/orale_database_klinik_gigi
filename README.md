The database developed is a database for the Pelita dentist clinic. The developer has the task of developing a data model for a dentist clinic database application system to store patient data, officers, doctors, visit history, diagnoses, drugs, and treatment rooms. In the system, patient information is needed such as patient name, telephone, age, gender; working officer information such as name of officer and title; information about each doctor's name, specialty, and information regarding the doctor treating the patient; Ward; and information about patient visits to determine the history of complaints and diagnosis of the patient. The prescription information given to each patient also needs to be tracked in this database including some basic information about the drugs prescribed to ensure that the patient is not allergic to the drugs given. We need to know the name of each drug. This database will later be used to store historical data from the dentist's clinic so that the medical records of each patient who visits can be known as well as the doctor who handles the patient.
